# nixos

## v0
- I've set up an EC2 instance running NixOS
- `v0` will include a preliminary set up, still involving a fair amount of dotfile management
- `v1` will introduce use of [flakes](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Flakes) and [home-manager](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/)
  - this should reduce dofile management and increase the modularity of my nix configuration
